Hello again,

As previously mentioned, I’m learning to code! This is my first attempt at building my own website using Hugo. 

I'm currently working on building tools to improve the e-commerce & fulfillment experience for independent record labels. From Shopify help to problematic zebra printers to DIY SoundScan reports &mdash;  I'm here to help, finding ways to automate all things tedious and frustrating.

I have been working in the music industry since 2009 — currently working with [Dispatch Dept.](http://www.dispatchdept.com) and previously working with [Temporary Residence Ltd.](http://www.temporaryresidence.com), [Domino Recording Company](https://www.dominomusic.com/us) & [Merge Records](http://www.mergerecords.com).
