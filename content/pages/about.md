Hello again,

I'm currently working on building tools to improve the e-commerce, manufacturing & fulfillment experience for independent record labels. From Shopify help to problematic Zebra printers to DIY SoundScan reports &mdash;  I'm here to help, finding ways to automate all things tedious and frustrating.

I have been working in the music industry since 2009 â€” previously working with [Temporary Residence Ltd.](http://www.temporaryresidence.com), [Domino Recording Company](https://www.dominomusic.com/us), [Merge Records](http://www.mergerecords.com) & [Dispatch Dept.](http://www.dispatchdept.com). 

[Email](mailto:cameliabrennan@gmail.com)me!
