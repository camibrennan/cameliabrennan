My name is Camelia. I am a long time music enthusiast from **Durham, North Carolina** with a penchant for physical retail. I recently relocated to **Bon Aqua, Tennessee** after living in **Brooklyn, New York** for several years. 

I'm looking forward to starting a garden and I've already learned how to make a sick cappuccino. :coffee:

Iâ€™m working on documenting solutions to common problems independent record labels face on the [tutorials]({{< ref "/posts/tutorials">}}) page, along with minor tricks I've learned as someone new to coding. I'm also writing about my favorite 20 albums of all time, and other miscellaneous music things in the [blog]({{< ref "/posts">}}) section.
