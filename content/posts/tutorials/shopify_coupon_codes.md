Making discount codes using Shopify is super easy and their help center is an excellent resource. I’ve listed some notes below about solutions to snags I’ve encountered that are specific to record labels, that don’t require using additional apps. 

You can create a discount code at check out (Home > Discounts > “create discount” button) or mark down individual items on their product page in the Pricing section:



Excluding pre-orders from discount code:

There is not currently an option to exclude titles with a pre-order tag etc., or exclude products within the discount code settings. You can only add what products are eligible for the discount in these settings. 

The most efficient work around I’ve found is to create a collection that excludes pre-orders, and apply the discount code to that collection. Go to Products > Collections > in my example, I created a collection called “catalog” .

In the catalog collection — I want to include all products except for pre-orders. To do this, you just need to list the product titles for all current pre-orders with the condition “does not contain”. You can reuse this for future discount codes but will need to update this to keep it current after each street date and as new pre-orders are announced.

You cannot separate different formats or variants of a release, unless they have a different product title. 

Next, you’ll list the new collection in your discount code settings under Applies To > Specific Products > catalog. I always test the discount code after doing this to make sure it is actually excluding pre-orders at check out, for good measure. If you have an album title typed wrong or a rogue space, it could result in it not actually being excluded, so its a good way to double check your work.

Customer Groups:

As far as I’ve found, “ Accepts Marketing” , “From United States” , “Prospects” and “Repeat Customers” appear to be the only customer groups you can target for a discount code. 

So if you want to pull a list of all customers who bought a specific item — ex: an apology coupon for vinyl delays — you cannot create a customer group based on purchases. We just made it available to everybody and hoped it would not be shared much outside of the customers we send the code to. Definitely let me know if anyone else has found a better solution to this and I will update!
