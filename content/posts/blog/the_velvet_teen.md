For the life of me, I cannot remember the name of a website I frequented in high school in the early 2000s, from a shared family computer in my mothers office. You could enter a band name, and it built out recommendations in a bubble map. As an adolescent girl, in addition to having a crush on every boy, I was also fixated with the entire Virginia post-hardcore scene. It almost goes without saying, but I was REALLY into **Engine Down**. This ultimately led to the recommendation of **The Velvet Teen** from the aforementioned website that I’ll never figure out the name of. 

As a freshman in college, I had very few friends. Most of my friends attended a school I knew I could not get into, near where we grew up, but I applied to Appalachian State University in Western North Carolina. I was disinterested in school in general, but attending a university never felt up for debate. After my application to ASU was accepted, I was pleased to not have to worry about applications anymore. However, I was still reluctant to be leaving my friends and a music scene that I didn’t realize I had taken for granted.

I was deeply saddened by the lack of music in the area where I went to college. Not to say it didn’t exist, but I wasn’t quite sure where to look, and I wasn’t brave enough to explore alone. At the time I attended school, it still felt like a commuter college. I often found myself driving 2–3 hours for shows in Asheville and Chapel Hill. Once I drove to Greensboro alone to see **Circle Takes The Square** only to find out the show had been canceled after I arrived there. Whoopsies! After growing up near Durham, Chapel Hill, and Raleigh, the Boone music scene left me feeling really lonely and I struggled to make friends without a common bond of music.

Fortunately, there was a record store in walking distance of my dorm. I knew The Velvet Teen had just come out with a new album in the summer of 2004 on **Slowdance Records** (R.I.P.), and I requested they order the CD. I had no idea what to expect with **_Elysium_**, I didn’t even know it was going to be completely void of guitars. The album consists of keyboard, piano, strings, and horns arranged beautifully. At the time, **Judah Nagler**’s vocals and lyrics struck me as romantic and empathetic, but cloaked with longing. “_We Were Bound (To Bend the Rules)_” without fail, makes my heart feel like it is breaking every time I hear it. Like most of the songs on the album, it’s so gorgeous that it almost takes your breath away. “_Chimera Obscurant_” has been my long time favorite track on the album, it’s a 12 minutes 50 second long masterpiece that spirals into an epic climax as Nagler’s tremendous piano playing and vocals continually build before they’re overtaken by strings and horns.

I don’t think I was mature enough to understand any of these songs when I first heard them at 18, and I still am skeptical of people who claim to understand lyrics not written by themself. But darn, this entire album feels like you’re in a fever dream soundscape about beauty and regret. Maybe the entire album is just about meth though, who knows! Either way, it’s a truly stunning and timeless piece of music that I highly recommend.
