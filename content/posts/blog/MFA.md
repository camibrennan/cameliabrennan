My most recent work can be found at **[Music For All](https://www.musicforall.club)** a project I started in October, 2021. 

We're facilitating honest discussions with musicians about the devastating consequences of censorship and restrictions on live performance. Our long term goal is to create resources and share information to help and encourage musicians succeed independently without a record label.
