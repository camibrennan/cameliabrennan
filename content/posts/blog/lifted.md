**_LIFTED Or The Story Is In The Soil, Keep Your Ear To The Ground_**
was the first CD I played after hysterically installing a a CD player into my beloved 1990 Pontiac 6000. What is the fucking point in being able to drive if you couldn't listen to ***Bright Eyes**, amirite ladies. 

During this this time, **Conor Oberst** was touring with a 16 piece orchestra and there were rumors of him falling off stage at drunk. As a 16 year old girl this all was FASCINATING. As someone who couldn't even legally purchase alcohoe &mdash; being an alcoholic seemed _VERY_ cool.

I'd never heard twangy guitars within my newfound emo obsession. The americana influences felt fresh to me, as well as the epic nature of these recordings. Oberst's screams over an orchestra really hit me as an angsty teenager, and there's still something very beautiful about the two in combination. 

The lyrics "Now all that anyone is listening for are the mistakes" followed by an apology of "oh I'm sorry" with the response "No it's ok, it's ok" at the end of "False Advertising", which then swells into a waltz always filled me with optimism.

Everything is going to be ok!

Just kidding. Cars don't even come with CD players anymore, basically no one even tries to purchase music and the U.S. military just killed 7 children with a drone strike. Conny O was right to be so sad all the time.
