The first time I saw **Empress Of** was in the summer of 2016, at **Pitchfork Music Festival**. It was one of those perfect festival shows where you’re packed into an insanely crowded space, but inebriated enough to not be annoyed by it, and simultaneously blown away by a breathtaking performance. **Lorely Rodriguez** commanded the room with her infectious electro pop music. Her signature hair twirled back and forth, as she danced with her head down — busy, attentive — while the entire room danced in unison, hypnotized. 

I was fortunate to have a dear friend and former colleague,  David, who introduced me to Empress Of. He was kind enough to curate much of what we listened to at work for a few years, due to my chronic indecisiveness. This was something I likely took for granted, but like so many things nowadays, miss terribly. He has wonderful taste in music, a sincere interest and a vast knowledge about music history and obscure genres. He was, without a doubt, the best person anyone could ask to be in charge of the stereo. 

Empress Of’s debut album **_Me_** is a stunning mixture of beautiful pop vocals and up tempo beats — all drenched in a Rodriguez’ self-produced sound, now easily identified as unique to her. Released in 2015 on **Terrible Records**, _Me_ is an instant classic for both pop fans and electronic music fans alike.
