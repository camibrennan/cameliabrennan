      <description>Hello again,
As previously mentioned, I’m learning to code! This is my first attempt at a site using Hugo.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on building tools to improve the e-commerce &amp;amp; fulfillment experience for independent record labels. From Shopify help to problematic zebra printers to DIY SoundScan reports — I&amp;rsquo;m here to help, finding ways to automate all things tedious and frustrating.
I have been working in the music industry since 2009 — currently working with Dispatch Dept.</description>
