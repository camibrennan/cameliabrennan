    <div class="content">
      <p>I talk about this probably too much, but <strong><em>De-Loused in the Comatorium</em></strong> by <strong>The Mars Volta</strong> is a very good album.</p>
<p>As a huge fan of <strong>At The Drive In</strong>, the future seemed very uncertain after their breakup in 2001. In 2003, I didn’t even know The Mars Volta existed until someone popped this CD into my car stereo. This was the first concept album I ever heard, as well as my first introduction to progressive rock.</p>
<p>Unlike most of my peers, I started my “indie rock” journey with very little exposure to classic rock, or anything that came out before 2001. As a pre-teen, I mostly listened to country and pop radio. My parents were not particularly avid music fans, though I do have one haunting memory of my mother blasting “I Want Your Sex” by <strong>George Michael</strong> while driving us through the mall parking lot as an apparent ploy to embarrass my sister and I to death. It was always unclear if this was a troll or the result of an actual appreciation of the music of George Michael. To this day, I’m pretty unclear what music my parents like, though I know my mother also enjoys a smooth jazz quartet by the name of <strong>Fourplay</strong>. This, again, feels more tied to making other people temporarily uncomfortable in conversation than sincere musical taste. I admire her commitment.</p>
<p>I am, of course, forever grateful that my father gifted me his record player in high school, but was always just a little sad I never had a cool uncle from like <a href="https://youtu.be/vyFx6cnoBXY"   target="_blank">New Jersey</a>
 or somewhere who would have introduced me to <strong>Rush</strong> or like… cool drugs. As a result, I’ve always been slightly self conscious that I lacked the building blocks to talk about music, since I was unable to reference the classics and cite influences easily. This wasn’t a real problem — but I remained jealous of people who could carry on an intelligent conversation about <strong>Frank Zappa</strong> or <strong>The Beatles</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the actual point — <em>De-Loused in the Comatorium</em> was really groundbreaking to someone like myself, without any background in psychedelic sonic adventures. The first time I heard <strong>Cedric Bixler-Zavala</strong>’s iconic vocals, as part of an epic concept album about a man in a coma from overdosing, my brain nearly exploded. If being in a week long coma and then dying is anything like this, sign me up! This album seamlessly transports you to a mesmerizing and chaotic place. But you can’t help feeling like you have to see it through to the end each time, and it’s oddly rejuvenating.</p>
<p>It’s so much more than the favorite album of the weird stoner guy you hated being in group projects with in college, but it is also that.</p>
